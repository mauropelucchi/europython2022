# Data warehouses meet data lakes @ EUROPYTHON 2022
## What is the question?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauropelucchi/europython2022/main/ep2022.png)

Many organizations have migrated their data warehouses to datalake solutions in recent years.
With the convergence of the data warehouse and the data lake, a new data management paradigm has emerged that combines the best of 2 approaches: the bottom-up of big data and the top-down of a classic data warehouse.

In this talk, I will explain the current challenges of a datalake and how we can approach a moderm data architecture with the help of pyspark, hudi, delta.io or iceberg. We will see how organize data in a data lake to support real-time processing of applications and analyzes across all varieties of data sets, structured and unstructured, how provides the scale needed to support enterprise-wide digital transformation and creates one unique source of data for multiple audiences.
